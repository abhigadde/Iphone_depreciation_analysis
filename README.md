# Iphone_depreciation_analysis
I investigate the question whether certain iPhone models hold their value better than others
The word doc has my written analysis. I also attached my python code so you can see how I scraped the website for the data I used. I also attached excel files containing the inputs and outputs from my python code so you can view the prices I pulled on that specific day.
If you have any questions, please reach out to me at abhinavgadde7@gmail.com.

Tools used: Python, Tableau
